<h1 class="title">What is MealFindr?</h1>
<h4>
  Since the start of the COVID19 pandemic, food insecurity in the state of
  Washington has nearly doubled! Local Seattle Eateries have created their own
  meal programs to help their community members. However, if you find yourself
  or your family facing food insecurity, you may not always know where to go for
  help. Thatâ€™s where MealFindr comes in! MealFindr was created to bridge that
  gap and provide users with a list of Seattle Eatery locations that offer a
  free meal to those who need it.
</h4>
<h2 class="title">Our Mission</h2>
<h5 class="title">
  To provide a free resource to find restaurants and locations that offer
  no-cost meals to those facing food insecurity.
